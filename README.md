# What's New?

This application was built with `create-react-app`.  This is my first application using React!  The main project goals were to get a feel for how React components, state, and props all work together to create an application.  

### Set Up

1. Clone down this repo.
2. CD into project folder, then run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start up your React server and view the App!

## Functionality

Users can browse news articles by topic.  Click on any topic in the left-side menu!  Users can also narrow their article search by utilizing the search bar at the top.

### Technologies Used

* REACT
* JSX
* React Testing Library, Jest, DOM Testing Library (testing)
* Vanilla JS
* CSS



## Learning Goals

## Get an initial feel for:
* Using the React Framework
* How React Components work together
* Passing Data using 'props'
* Updating 'state' with user interaction
* Creating functions and Methods with a single responsibility



## Challenges

The biggest challenge of the project involved learning the testing library syntax and how it all flowed together.  That was difficult and I still have much to learn.  It was also a challenge to only have one class based component to hold state.  In the future I would likely have the searchForm hold state as well or think of a way to pass around and manipulate data in a more efficient way.

## Wins

This was a very fun project!  React is a powerful application framework and I look forward to learning more!  I was able to move around the data using props, update the state based on user interactions, and get some initial testing going.  I would like to complete the tests and eventually bring the data in using a Fetch API call.
